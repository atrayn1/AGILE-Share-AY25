## Individual Commitment
We will invest an equal amount of effort and help eachother understand the project and reach goals.

## Missed Deadlines
Our main in regards to missing deadlines is to set reasonable expectations for how much work will be done before each deadline. If a deadline is missed, then we will communicate why and a plan to finish the work as a team.

## Unacceptable Work/Performance
At deadlines, look over each others work and communicate concerns with the quality of the work they did. If someone is not performing then we will have an intervention about their performance.
